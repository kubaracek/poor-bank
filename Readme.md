### Notes

I hope I did the calculations correctly. However this ends, thanks.
That was a fun project to make :)

Due to the tight timeschedule, the final calculations are a bit crude and they
should be a conduit pipe themself -> the same way as the simulation is.

## Running

### Nix

For nix users, there's a `make run` or manually `nix-build release.nix && result/bin/exe`

### Stack

`stac run`
